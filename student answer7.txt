The nitrogen cycle is a biogeochemical mechanism in which nitrogen is converted into a variety of forms before returning to the atmosphere 
through the soil and organism. Nitrogen fixation, nitrification, denitrification, decay, and putrefaction are some of the processes involved . 
Both organic and inorganic sources of nitrogen gas exist. Organic nitrogen is found in living organisms and is passed down the food chain by other 
living organisms consumption.
