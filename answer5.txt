To manage large multimedia data objects efficiently, these data objects need to be compressed to reduce the file size for storage of these objects. 
Data compression is the process of encoding information using fewer bits than an unencoded representation would use, through use of specific encoding schemes. 
Compression tries to eliminate redundancies in the pattern of data . 
Once redundancies are removed, the data objects requires less disk memory space for storage & also less time for transmission .â€‹
There are two main types of compression: lossy and lossless . 
Lossy compression removes some of a files original data in order to reduce the file size . This might mean reducing the numbers of colours in an image or reducing the number of samples in a sound file . This can result in a small loss of quality of an image or sound file . 
Lossless compression doesnt reduce the quality of the file at all . No data is lost, so lossless compression allows a file to be recreated exactly as it was when originally created .
