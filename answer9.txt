Hypothesis testing is an act in statistics whereby an analyst tests an assumption regarding a population parameter . 
The methodology employed by the analyst depends on the nature of the data used and the reason for the analysis . 
Hypothesis testing is used to assess the plausibility of a hypothesis by using sample data . 
Such data may come from a larger population, or from a data-generating process . 
The word population will be used for both of these cases in the following descriptions . 
In hypothesis testing, an analyst tests a statistical sample, with the goal of providing evidence on the plausibility of the null hypothesis . 
The null hypothesis is usually a hypothesis of equality between population parameters; e.g., a null hypothesis may state that the population mean return is equal to zero . 
The alternative hypothesis is effectively the opposite of a null hypothesis (e.g., the population mean return is not equal to zero) . 
Thus, they are mutually exclusive, and only one can be true. However, one of the two hypotheses will always be true.
