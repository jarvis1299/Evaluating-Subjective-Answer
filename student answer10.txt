Electromagnetism is the development of a magnetic field by passing current through a conductor.
Magnetic lines of force are produced when a conductor is electrically charged.
If current (positive charges move in a wire), for example, induces a magnetic field along the wire, the position of magnetic lines and force can be
calculated using the Right-hand Rule. For a more comprehensive description, see the picture.
The electromagnetic force is a form of physical interaction that happens when electrically charged particles interact with each other.
It is a combination of both magnetic and electrical forces that work between charged particles.
The electromagnetic force can be both attractive or repulsive.
