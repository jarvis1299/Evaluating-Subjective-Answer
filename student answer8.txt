One of the four laws of thermodynamics is the zeroth law of thermodynamics. 
Ralph H. Fowler is credited with drafting the legislation. 
The zeroth law of thermodynamics, interestingly enough, was formulated much later than the original three laws. 
However, there was some debate about nomenclature whether it should be referred to as the fourth law or by another name. 
The complication arose because the new legislation provided a much simpler description of temperature and effectively repealed the previous three rules. 
Fowler finally came up with a name that would put an end to the fight. 
The definition of temperature as an indicator of thermal equilibrium is framed by the zeroth law of thermodynamics.
