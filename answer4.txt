JPEG is a standardized image compression mechanism . 
JPEG stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group, the original name of the committee that wrote the standard . 
JPEG compresses either full-color or grayscale images, and works best with photographs and artwork . 
For geometric line drawings, lettering, cartoons, computer screenshots, and other images with flat color and sharp borders, the PNG and GIF image formats are usually preferable . 
JPEG uses a lossy compression method, meaning that the decompressed image isn't quite the same as the original . 
This method fools the eye by using the fact that people perceive small changes in color less accurately than small changes in brightness .
