Nitrogen Cycle is a biogeochemical process through which nitrogen is converted into many forms, consecutively passing from the atmosphere to 
the soil to organism and back into the atmosphere . 
It involves several processes such as nitrogen fixation, nitrification, denitrification, decay and putrefaction . 
The nitrogen gas exists in both organic and inorganic forms . 
Organic nitrogen exists in living organisms, and they get passed through the food chain by the consumption of other living organisms . 
Inorganic forms of nitrogen are found in abundance in the atmosphere . 
This nitrogen is made available to plants by symbiotic bacteria which can convert the inert nitrogen into a usable form such as nitrites and nitrates . 
Nitrogen undergoes various types of transformation to maintain a balance in the ecosystem . 
Furthermore, this process extends to various biomes, with the marine nitrogen cycle being one of the most complicated biogeochemical cycles.
